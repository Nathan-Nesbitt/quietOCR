# quietOCR
OCR script for OSX

This script is designed to OCR one file at a time. It can be used to do a directory by specifying -a, but will run differently ./quietOCR.sh -a <fullDirectoryPath>. If you want to get the text by itself, run it with the -n parameter after -a (or first for single file).
